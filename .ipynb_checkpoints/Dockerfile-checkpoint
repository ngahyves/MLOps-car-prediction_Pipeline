# Dockerfile

# --- Step 1: Select the base picture ---
FROM python:3.9-slim

# --- Step 2: Define the working directory ---
WORKDIR /app

# --- Step 3: Install dependences ---
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# --- Step 4: Copy the rest of the application ---
COPY . .

# --- Step 5: Expose the port ---
EXPOSE 8000

# --- Step 6: Define the startup command ---
# "api:app" -> in the api.py file, find the app object.
# "--host 0.0.0.0" -> crucial, allows the API to be accessible from outside the container.
# "--port 8000" -> the port on which uvicorn will listen (must match EXPOSE).
CMD ["uvicorn", "api:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
